# Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.

# For example, assume her scores for the season are represented in the array scores = [12,24,10,24]. Scores are in the same order as the games played. She would tabulate her results as follows:

#                                 Count

# Game  Score  Minimum  Maximum   Min Max

#  0      12     12       12       0   0

#  1      24     12       24       0   1

#  2      10     10       24       1   1

#  3      24     10       24       1   1
 

# Given the scores for a season, find and print the number of times Maria breaks her records for most and least points scored during the season.

# Function Description

# Complete the breakingRecords function in the editor below. It must return an integer array containing the numbers of times she broke her records. Index 0 is for breaking most points records, and index 1 is for breaking least points records.

# breakingRecords has the following parameter(s):

# scores: an array of integers
# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer n, the number of games.

# The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective values of .score(0),score(1),â€¦.score(n-1)

# Constraints

# 1<=n<=1000
# 0<=scores[i]<=10^8
# Output Format

# Print two space-seperated integers describing the respective numbers of times the best (highest) score increased and the worst (lowest) score decreased.

# Sample Input 0

# 9

# 10 5 20 20 4 5 2 25 1
 

# Sample Output 0

# 2 4
